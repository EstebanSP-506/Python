Run the following commands:

pip install Django==1.11.9

--this installs Django version 1.11.9 specifically

pip list

--list of installed pip modules

pip install Django==1.11.9 (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)

-- if the version were different, this would replace old version with the one indicated

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)

--will output a list of installed packages and their versions. It also allows you to write those packages to a file that can later be used to set up a new environment.

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?

--- it generates file requirements.txt including current

pip uninstall Django

-uninstalls Django

pip show Django

pip search Flask. This one might take a moment to execute.

---search for all PyPI packages whose name or summary contains "Flask" and list them
